README

1. Individuals working on this project:
"Americo Rodriguez" <arodrig3>
"Chetana Kethinedi" <ckethin> 
"Swetha Surapaneni" <ssurapa2>

2. Which test framework (Test::Unit or RSpec) you are using
RSPEC & Capybara

3. Starting URL for the application.  
http://127.0.0.1:3000

4. Command(s) to run to start the app
rails server -e development -p 3000

5. Information and credential needed for testing
user: admin@ncsu.edu
pw:   123456
It is assumed that the tester will create his/her own user in the application which they will then use for testing purposes.

6. Other notes (extra-credit functionality implemented, limitations, etc.)
The team used RSPEC and some aspects of Capybara to automate the test results. Also, the reply functionality is a bit lacking as well because of time constraints driven by the learning curve also. We feel it is important to note that combined, the three of us have put in well over 100 hours in tackling the project. Thus, committment was not an issue. Our primary sticking points consistently revolved around learning the new language, framework, versioning respository, and IDE as none of were familiar with any of these technologies.

Misc:
Commands to reset the database and seed test data if needed:
rake db:reset
rake db:populate

Note the team leaned heavily on the rails tutorial website to create this application as it had some very useful information and relevant examples.http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book
